# DistroMash

DistroMash meshes your docker image distribution.

## TODO

- Do I need a database?? Everything is distributed through CRDT. Maybe to backup? In that case migrations? [https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate#cli-usage](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate#cli-usage)

- Check `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` here in [https://github.com/create-go-app/fiber-go-template](https://github.com/create-go-app/fiber-go-template)
