# DistroMash

## TODO

- Add Swagger in Docs

  - This [https://github.com/swaggo/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)?
  - Or this [https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)?

- Add [https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
  [https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)

- Do I need a database?? Everything is distributed through CRDT. Maybe to backup? In that case migrations? [https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate#cli-usage](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate#cli-usage)

- Check `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` here in [https://github.com/create-go-app/fiber-go-template](https://github.com/create-go-app/fiber-go-template)
